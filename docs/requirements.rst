Requirements
============

Cerridwen depends on Python 3. You might be able to make
it work with Python 2 as well. Patches welcome! Please let
me know if there's a version of Python 3 that does not
run Cerridwen properly.

It also depends on these packages:

* pyswisseph, the Python interface to the Swiss Ephemeris library

* numpy, which Cerridwen uses for its ephemeris calculations

* Flask, if you wish to run Cerridwen's API server

These dependencies will be installed automatically as needed.
