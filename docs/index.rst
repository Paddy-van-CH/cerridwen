Cerridwen
=========

Cerridwen provides solar system data that is suitable for both astronomical
and astrological purposes. It comes with a simple command-line utility and
a JSON server, but is also designed to serve as a basis for your own
application.

The motivation for this package is to have a reliable open-source library
and API that provides comprehensive data on various planetary bodies and
factors at a certain point in time.
