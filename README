Requirements
============

Cerridwen depends on Python 3. You might be able to make
it work with Python 2 as well.

You'll also need

* pyswisseph, the Python interface to the Swiss Ephemeris library

* numpy, which Cerridwen uses for its ephemeris calculations

* Flask, if you wish to run Cerridwen's API server


Quickstart
==========

To test Cerridwen's data on the console, invoke:

```
$ python3 cli.py
```

If everything is to your satisfaction you can then
start the API server:

```
$ python3 api_server.py
```

It will start up in the foreground and listen on port 5000,
serving moon data via HTTP in JSON format at the URI `/v1/moon`.

So, to test it:

```
$ curl http://localhost:5000/v1/moon
```

This should give you a proper JSON response with
the current moon data.
