Cerridwen
=========
Cerridwen provides data on the moon that is suitable
for both astronomical and astrological purposes. It
comes with a simple command-line utility and a JSON
server.

The motivation for this package is to have a reliable
open-source library and API that provides data on the
moon and, eventually, other planetary bodies at a certain
point in time.


Requirements
============

Cerridwen depends on Python 3. You might be able to make
it work with Python 2 as well.

You'll also need

* pyswisseph, the Python interface to the Swiss Ephemeris library

* numpy, which Cerridwen uses for its ephemeris calculations

* Flask, if you wish to run Cerridwen's API server


Quickstart
==========

To test Cerridwen's data on the console, invoke:

```
$ python3 cli.py
```

If everything is to your satisfaction you can then
start the API server:

```
$ python3 api_server.py
```

It will start up in the foreground and listen on port 5000,
serving moon data via HTTP in JSON format at the URI `/v1/moon`.

So to test it invoke:

```
$ curl http://localhost:5000/v1/moon
```

This should give you a proper JSON response with
the current moon data.


FAQ
===

.h3 What's the guaranteed precision of the generated data?

For new and full moons (and other angles) the maximum error is smaller than 1/10^6.


.h3 What zodiac is used for the longitudes?

All longitudes whether absolute or relative use the tropical zodiac, i.e. zero degrees
equals zero degrees Aries equals the vernal equinox of the year in question.


.h3 What about other planetary bodies?

The source code is designed to be easily extensible to other planets and points.
The goal is to add more planets once the moon interface is reasonably mature.


.h3 Will you add more moon data?

Yes! For example equatorial latitude, lunation number and rise/set times.


.h3 How can I help?

First and foremost: use it! Also: tell your friends and fellow astronomers/astrologers!

You can also help write docs, contribute source code and tell me what you'd like
to see in the project.


.h3 Are you from Wales?

No. But it's a nice place with rich mythology. :)
